# Weather-Invariant Object Detection: Enhancing YOLOv8 with Environment-Adaptive Preprocessing for Robust Performance Across Diverse Conditions
The folder test contains the test dataset upon which the trained YOLOv8 model and the CNN classifier were tested upon.

I have provided the original dataset and the augmented dataset so the users may feel free to skip the augmentation part of the code

Please find below the link to the dataset:
